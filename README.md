# Selenium Lab
__Introduction__

Selenium is an extremely popular testing tool for web UI testing. Selenium is free & open source, making it a great option for most developers. There are three components offered in the Selenium Suite â€“ WebDriver, IDE, and Grid. This tutorial will focus on WebDriver.

__Getting Started__
1. You will need to install the Selenium bindings for your desired language. Below is how you would use Pip if using Python.

   ```
   pip install selenium
   ```
2. Open your IDE of choice. Import the required packages and start the session with WebDriver (assuming you're using Chrome).

   ```
   from selenium import webdriver
   from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
   driver = webdriver.Chrome()
   ```
3. Navigate to a webpage of your choice (we're using Wake Tech's for example purposes).

   ```
   driver.get("https://www.waketech.edu/")
   ```
4. Request the title of the webpage.

   ```
   title = driver.title
   ```
5. Print all cookies from the webpage.

   ```
   print(driver.get_cookies())
   ```
6. Quit the session

   ```
   driver.quit()
   ```
